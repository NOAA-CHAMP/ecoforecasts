MATLAB Toolbox to forecast ecological impacts ("ecoforecasts") using expert-systems rules based on environmental data

The "ecoforecasts" repository contains a MATLAB Toolbox developed at NOAA-AOML in Miami, for processing and analyzing environmental time series and spatial fields (including in situ observations, satellite products, model outputs), for the purposes of forecasting, now-casting, or back-casting potential marine ecological impacts ("ecoforecasts") using expert-systems rules based on those data.
